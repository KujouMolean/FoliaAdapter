# What

A Folia library(plugin) designed to provide migration tools to help bukkit and paper plugins migrate to Folia with minor modifications.

The difference between it and other libraries is that it only requires keyword replacement without modifying the code structure.

Currently only for Paper and Folia 1.21+

# Features

* dummy scoreborad api
* folia scheduler
* folia event call bypass thread check
* scheduler context (powerful tool for migrating complex large plugins, )
* Folia block/entity batch task
* folia tools (provide some nms function, especially useful for maven project without paperweight)

Cooperating with [FoliaNeeds](https://github.com/KujouMolean/FoliaNeeds) is better.
